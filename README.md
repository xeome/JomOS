# Discontinuation Notice: JomOS

I regret to inform you that JomOS will be discontinued. Unfortunately, I'm unable to continue maintaining the project due to time constraints.

I apologize for any inconvenience caused by this discontinuation. Thank you for your understanding.

# JomOS

JomOS is a meta Linux distribution which allows users to mix-and-match
well tested configurations and optimizations with little to no effort.
 
JomOS integrates these configurations into one largely cohesive system.

Please keep in mind that everything is still in the works, so use it at your own risk.
